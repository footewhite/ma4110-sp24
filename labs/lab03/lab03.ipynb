    "In this lab, you'll first see how to represent and manipulate another fundamental type of data: text.  A piece of text is called a *string* in Python. You'll also see how to work with *arrays* of data, such as all the numbers between 0 and 100 or all the words in the chapter of a book. Lastly, you'll create tables and practice analyzing them with your knowledge of table operations.\n",

Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should **not** _just_ copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",

Make a copy of `imdb` that includes that column (`imdb.with_column(...)` returns a new table).  Then use `where` to find rows where that new column is equal to 0.  Then use `num_rows` to count the number of such rows.\n",
