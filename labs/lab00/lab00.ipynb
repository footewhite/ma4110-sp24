You should **not** _just_ copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",

Inline links are a design pattern that uses hyperlinked words — conventionally blue, underlined words — to guide users to another page containing related information. Designers employ inline links so that the information linked from the highlighted words does not clutter the user's current webpage. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets `( [ ] )`, and then you wrap the link in parenthesis `( ( ) )`. For example, to create a hyperlink to www.ncssm.edu, with a link text that says, Visit NCSSM!, you'd write this in Markdown: `[Visit NCSSM!](http://www.ncssm.edu)`.\n",
