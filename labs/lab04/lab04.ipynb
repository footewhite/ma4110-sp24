    "### Why is `apply` useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "For operations like arithmetic, or the functions in the NumPy library, you don't need to use `apply`, because they automatically work on each element of an array. These types of functions are called **vectorized** in data science langauge. However, there are many functions that aren't written in a way that they work on each element in an array automatically. The string manipulation we did in today's lab is one example.  Since you can write any code you want in a function, `apply` gives you the power to use it on every element in an array without knowing how to properly **vectorize** your functions."
